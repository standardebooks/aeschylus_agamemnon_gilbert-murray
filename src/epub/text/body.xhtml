<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>
The sense of difficulty, and indeed of awe, with which a scholar approaches the
task of translating the <i>Agamemnon</i> depends directly on its greatness as
poetry. It is in part a matter of diction. The language of Aeschylus is an
extraordinary thing, the syntax stiff and simple, the vocabulary obscure,
unexpected, and steeped in splendour. Its peculiarities cannot be disregarded,
or the translation will be false in character. Yet not Milton himself could
produce in English the same great music, and a translator who should strive
ambitiously to represent the complex effect of the original would clog his own
powers of expression and strain his instrument to breaking. But, apart from the
diction in this narrower sense, there is a quality of atmosphere surrounding
the <i>Agamemnon</i> which seems almost to defy reproduction in another
setting, because it depends in large measure on the position of the play in the
historical development of Greek literature.
</p>
<p>
If we accept the view that all Art to some extent, and Greek tragedy in a very
special degree, moves in its course of development from Religion to
Entertainment, from a Service to a Performance, the <i>Agamemnon</i> seems to
stand at a critical point where the balance of the two elements is near
perfection. The drama has come fully to life, but the religion has not yet
faded to a formality. The <i>Agamemnon</i> is not, like Aeschylus’
<i>Suppliant Women</i>, a statue half-hewn out of the rock. It is a real play,
showing clash of character and situation, suspense and movement, psychological
depth and subtlety. Yet it still remains something more than a play. Its
atmosphere is not quite of this world. In the long lyrics especially one feels
that the guiding emotion is not the entertainer’s wish to thrill an
audience, not even perhaps the pure artist’s wish to create beauty, but
something deeper and more prophetic, a passionate contemplation and expression
of truth; though of course the truth in question is something felt rather than
stated, something that pervades life, an eternal and majestic rhythm like the
movement of the stars.
</p>
<p>
Thus, if Longinus is right in defining Sublimity as “the ring, or
resonance, of greatness of soul,” one sees in part where the sublimity of
the <i>Agamemnon</i> comes from. And it is worth noting that the faults which
some critics have found in the play are in harmony with this conclusion. For
the sublimity that is rooted in religion tolerates some faults and utterly
refuses to tolerate others. The <i>Agamemnon</i> may be slow in getting to
work; it may be stiff with antique conventions. It never approaches to being
cheap or insincere or shallow or sentimental or showy. It never ceases to be
genuinely a “criticism of life.” The theme which it treats, for
instance, is a great theme in its own right; it is not a made-up story
ingeniously handled.
</p>
<p>
The trilogy of the <i>Oresteia</i>, of which this play is the first part,
centres on the old and everlastingly unsolved problem of
</p>
<p class="poem">
The ancient blinded vengeance and the wrong that amendeth wrong.
</p>
<p>
Every wrong is justly punished; yet, as the world goes, every punishment
becomes a new wrong, calling for fresh vengeance. And more; every wrong turns
out to be itself rooted in some wrong of old. It is never gratuitous, never
untempted by the working of Peitho (Persuasion), never merely wicked. The
<i>Oresteia</i> first shows the cycle of crime punished by crime which must be
repunished, and then seeks for some gleam of escape, some breaking of the
endless chain of “evil duty.” In the old order of earth and heaven
there was no such escape. Each blow called for the return blow and must do so
<i>ad infinitum</i>. But, according to Aeschylus, there is a new Ruler now in
heaven, one who has both sinned and suffered and thereby grown wise. He is Zeus
the Third Power, Zeus the Saviour, and his gift to mankind is the ability
through suffering to Learn (pp. 7 f.)
</p>
<p>
At the opening of the <i>Agamemnon</i> we find Clytemnestra alienated from her
husband and secretly befriended with his ancestral enemy, Aigisthos. The air is
heavy and throbbing with hate; hate which is evil but has its due cause.
Agamemnon, obeying the prophet Calchas, when the fleet lay storm-bound at
Aulis, had given his own daughter, Iphigenîa, as a human sacrifice. And if we
ask how a sane man had consented to such an act, we are told of his gradual
temptation; the deadly excuse offered by ancient superstition; and above all,
the fact that he had already inwardly accepted the great whole of which this
horror was a part. At the first outset of his expedition against Troy there had
appeared an omen, the bloody sign of two eagles devouring a mother-hare with
her unborn young…. The question was thus put to the Kings and their prophet:
Did they or did they not accept the sign, and wish to be those Eagles? And they
had answered Yes. They would have their vengeance, their full and extreme
victory, and were ready to pay the price. The sign once accepted, the prophet
recoils from the consequences which, in prophetic vision, he sees following
therefrom: but the decision has been taken, and the long tale of cruelty rolls
on, culminating in the triumphant sack of Troy, which itself becomes not an
assertion of Justice but a whirlwind of godless destruction. And through all
these doings of fierce beasts and angry men the unseen Pity has been alive and
watching, the Artemis who “abhors the Eagles’ feast,” the
“Apollo or Pan or Zeus” who hears the crying of the robbed vulture;
nay, if even the Gods were deaf, the mere “wrong of the dead” at
Troy might waken, groping for some retribution upon the “Slayer of Many
Men” (pp. 15, 20).
</p>
<p>
If we ask why men are so blind, seeking their welfare thus through incessant
evil, Aeschylus will tell us that the cause lies in the infection of old sin,
old cruelty. There is no doubt somewhere a
πρώταρχος Ἄτη, a
“first blind deed of wrong,” but in practice every wrong is the
result of another. And the Children of Atreus are steeped to the lips in them.
When the prophetess Cassandra, out of her first vague horror at the evil House,
begins to grope towards some definite image, first and most haunting comes the
sound of the weeping of two little children, murdered long ago, in a feud that
was not theirs. From that point, more than any other, the Daemon or Genius of
the House—more than its “Luck,” a little less than its
Guardian Angel—becomes an Alastor or embodied Curse, a “Red
Slayer” which cries ever for peace and cleansing, but can seek them only
in the same blind way, through vengeance, and, when that fails, then through
more vengeance (p. 69).
</p>
<p>
This awful conception of a race intent upon its own wrongs, and blindly groping
towards the very terror it is trying to avoid, is typified, as it were, in the
Cassandra story. That daughter of Priam was beloved by Apollo, who gave her the
power of true prophecy. In some way that we know not, she broke her promise to
the God; and, since his gift could not be recalled, he added to it the curse
that, while she should always foresee and foretell the truth, none should
believe her. The Cassandra scene is a creation beyond praise or criticism. The
old scholiast speaks of the “pity and amazement” which it causes.
The Elders who talk with her wish to believe, they try to understand, they are
really convinced of Cassandra’s powers. But the curse is too strong. The
special thing which Cassandra tries again and again to say always eludes them,
and they can raise no finger to prevent the disaster happening. And when it
does happen they are, as they have described themselves, weak and very old,
“dreams wandering in the daylight.”
</p>
<p>
The characters of this play seem, in a sense, to arise out of the theme and
consequently to have, amid all their dramatic solidity, a further significance
which is almost symbolic. Cassandra is, as it were, the incarnation of that
knowledge which Herodotus describes as the crown of sorrow, the knowledge which
sees and warns and cannot help (Hdt. ix. 16). Agamemnon himself, the King of
Kings, triumphant and doomed, is a symbol of pride and the fall of pride. We
must not think of him as bad or specially cruel. The watchman loved him (ll. 34
f.), and the lamentations of the Elders over his death have a note of personal
affection (pp. 66 ff.). But I suspect that Aeschylus, a believer in the mystic
meaning of names, took the name Agamemnon to be a warning that
Ἄγα μίμνει, “the unseen
Wrath abides.” <i>Agâ</i>, of course, is not exactly wrath; it is more
like Nemesis, the feeling that something is ἄγαν,
“too much,” the condemnation of <i>Hubris</i> (pride or overgrowth)
and of all things that are in excess. <i>Agâ</i> is sometimes called “the
jealousy of God,” but such a translation is not happy. It is not the
jealousy, nor even the indignation, of a personal God, but the profound
repudiation and reversal of Hubris which is the very law of the Cosmos. Through
all the triumph of the conqueror, this <i>Agâ</i> abides.
</p>
<p>
The greatest and most human character of the whole play is Clytemnestra. She is
conceived on the grand Aeschylean scale, a scale which makes even Lady Macbeth
and Beatrice Cenci seem small; she is more the kinswoman of Brynhild. Yet she
is full not only of character, but of subtle psychology. She is the first and
leading example of that time-honoured ornament of the tragic stage, the
sympathetic, or semi-sympathetic, heroine-criminal. Aeschylus employs none of
the devices of later playwrights to make her interesting. He admits, of course,
no approach to a love-scene; he uses no sophisms; but he does make us see
through Clytemnestra’s eyes and feel through her passions. The agony of
silent prayer in which, if my conception is right, we first see her, helps to
interpret her speeches when they come; but every speech needs close study. She
dare not speak sincerely or show her real feelings until Agamemnon is dead; and
then she is practically a mad woman.
</p>
<p>
For I think here that there is a point which has not been observed. It is that
Clytemnestra is conceived as being really “possessed” by the Daemon
of the House when she commits her crime. Her statements on p. 69 are not empty
metaphor. A careful study of the scene after the murder will show that she
appears first “possessed” and almost insane with triumph, utterly
dominating the Elders and leaving them no power to answer. Then gradually the
unnatural force dies out from her. The deed that was first an ecstasy of
delight becomes an “affliction” (pp. 72, 76). The strength that
defied the world flags and changes into a longing for peace. She has done her
work. She has purified the House of its madness; now let her go away and live
out her life in quiet. When Aigisthos appears, and the scene suddenly becomes
filled with the wrangling of common men, Clytemnestra fades into a long
silence, from which she only emerges at the very end of the drama to pray again
for Peace, and, strangest of all, to utter the entreaty: “Let us not
stain ourselves with blood!” The splash of her husband’s blood was
visible on her face at the time. Had she in her trance-like state actually
forgotten, or did she, even then, not feel that particular blood to be a stain?
</p>
<p>
To some readers it will seem a sort of irrelevance, or at least a blurring of
the dramatic edge of this tragedy, to observe that the theme on which it is
founded was itself the central theme both of Greek Tragedy and of Greek
Religion. The fall of Pride, the avenging of wrong by wrong, is no new subject
selected by Aeschylus. It forms both the commonest burden of the moralising
lyrics in Greek tragedy and even of the tragic myths themselves; and recent
writers have shown how the same idea touches the very heart of the traditional
Greek religion. “The life of the Year-Daemon, who lies at the root of so
many Greek gods and heroes, is normally a story of Pride and Punishment. Each
year arrives, waxes great, commits the sin of Hubris and must therefore die. It
is the way of all Life. As an early philosopher expresses it, “All things
pay retribution for their injustice one to another according to the ordinance
of Time.”<a href="#fn-1.1" id="fnref-1.1" class="pginternal"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
To me this consideration actually increases the interest and beauty of the
<i>Oresteia</i>, because it increases its greatness. The majestic art, the
creative genius, the instinctive eloquence of these plays—that eloquence
which is the mere despair of a translator—are all devoted to the
expression of something which Aeschylus felt to be of tremendous import. It was
not his discovery; but it was a truth of which he had an intense realization.
It had become something which he must with all his strength bring to expression
before he died, not in a spirit of self-assertion or of argument, like a
discoverer, but as one devoted to something higher and greater than himself, in
the spirit of an interpreter or prophet.

This waste of year-long vigil I have prayed<br/>
God for some respite, watching elbow-stayed,<br/>
As sleuthhounds watch, above the Atreidae’s hall,<br/>
Till well I know yon midnight festival<br/>
Of swarming stars, and them that lonely go,<br/>
Bearers to man of summer and of snow,<br/>
Great lords and shining, throned in heavenly fire.<br/>
And still I await the sign, the beacon pyre<br/>
That bears Troy’s capture on a voice of flame<br/>
Shouting o’erseas. So surely to her aim<br/>
Cleaveth a woman’s heart, man-passioned!<br/>
And when I turn me to my bed—my bed<br/>
Dew-drenched and dark and stumbling, to which near<br/>
Cometh no dream nor sleep, but alway Fear<br/>
Breathes round it, warning, lest an eye once fain<br/>
To close may close too well to wake again;<br/>
Think I perchance to sing or troll a tune<br/>
For medicine against sleep, the music soon<br/>
Changes to sighing for the tale untold<br/>
Of this house, not well mastered as of old.<br/>
Howbeit, may God yet send us rest, and light<br/>
The flame of good news flashed across the night.

Of dawn and dancing upon Argive earth<br/>
For this great end! All hail!—What ho, within!<br/>
What ho! Bear word to Agamemnon’s queen<br/>
To rise, like dawn, and lift in answer strong<br/>
To this glad lamp her women’s triumph-song,<br/>
If verily, verily, Ilion’s citadel<br/>
Is fallen, as yon beacons flaming tell.<br/>
And I myself will tread the dance before<br/>
All others; for my master’s dice I score<br/>
Good, and mine own to-night three sixes plain.

Ten years since Ilion’s righteous foes,<br/>
The Atreidae strong,<br/>
Menelaüs and eke Agamemnon arose,<br/>
Two thrones, two sceptres, yoked of God;<br/>
And a thousand galleys of Argos trod<br/>
The seas for the righting of wrong;<br/>
And wrath of battle about them cried,<br/>
As vultures cry,<br/>
Whose nest is plundered, and up they fly<br/>
In anguish lonely, eddying wide,<br/>
Great wings like oars in the waste of sky,<br/>
Their task gone from them, no more to keep<br/>
Watch o’er the vulture babes asleep.<br/>
But One there is who heareth on high<br/>
Some Pan or Zeus, some lost Apollo—<br/>
That keen bird-throated suffering cry<br/>
Of the stranger wronged in God’s own sky;<br/>
And sendeth down, for the law transgressed,<br/>
The Wrath of the Feet that follow.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
So Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend,<br/>
Zeus who Prevaileth, in after quest<br/>
For One Belovèd by Many Men<br/>
On Paris sent the Atreidae twain;<br/>
Yea, sent him dances before the end<br/>
For his bridal cheer,<br/>
Wrestlings heavy and limbs forespent<br/>
For Greek and Trojan, the knee earth-bent,<br/>
The bloody dust and the broken spear.<br/>
He knoweth, that which is here is here,<br/>
And that which Shall Be followeth near;<br/>
He seeketh God with a great desire,<br/>
He heaps his gifts, he essays his pyre<br/>
With torch below and with oil above,<br/>
With tears, but never the wrath shall move<br/>
Of the Altar cold that rejects his fire.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
We saw the Avengers go that day,<br/>
And they left us here; for our flesh is old<br/>
And serveth not; and these staves uphold<br/>
A strength like the strength of a child at play.<br/>
For the sap that springs in the young man’s hand<br/>
And the valour of age, they have left the land.<br/>
And the passing old, while the dead leaf blows<br/>
And the old staff gropeth his three-foot way,<br/>
Weak as a babe and alone he goes,<br/>
A dream left wandering in the day.

[<i>Coming near the Central Altar they see</i> CLYTEMNESTRA, <i>who is still
rapt in prayer</i>.]
</p>
<p class="noindent">But thou, O daughter of Tyndareus,<br/>
Queen Clytemnestra, what need? What news?<br/>
What tale or tiding hath stirred thy mood<br/>
To send forth word upon all our ways<br/>
For incensed worship? Of every god<br/>
That guards the city, the deep, the high,<br/>
Gods of the mart, gods of the sky,<br/>
The altars blaze.<br/>
One here, one there,<br/>
To the skyey night the firebrands flare,<br/>
Drunk with the soft and guileless spell<br/>
Of balm of kings from the inmost cell.<br/>
Tell, O Queen, and reject us not,<br/>
All that can or that may be told,<br/>
And healer be to this aching thought,<br/>
Which one time hovereth, evil-cold,<br/>
And then from the fires thou kindlest<br/>
Will Hope be kindled, and hungry Care<br/>
Fall back for a little while, nor tear<br/>
The heart that beateth below my breast.

[CLYTEMNESTRA <i>rises silently, as though unconscious of their presence, and
goes into the House. The</i> CHORUS <i>take position and begin their first
Stasimon, or Standing-song,</i>]
</p>
<p class="noindent">CHORUS.<br/>
(<i>The sign seen on the way; Eagles tearing a hare with young</i>.)</p>
<p class="noindent">It is ours to tell of the <a href="#fn-4" id="fnref-4" class="pginternal">Sign of the War-way</a> given,<br/>
To men more strong,<br/>
(For a life that is kin unto ours yet breathes from heaven<br/>
A spell, a Strength of Song:)<br/>
How the twin-throned Might of Achaia, one Crown divided<br/>
Above all Greeks that are,<br/>
With avenging hand and spear upon Troy was guided<br/>
By the Bird of War.<br/>
’Twas a King among birds to each of the Kings of the Sea,<br/>
One Eagle black, one black but of fire-white tail,<br/>
By the House, on the Spear-hand, in station that all might see;<br/>
And they tore a hare, and the life in her womb that grew,<br/>
Yea, the life unlived and the races unrun they slew.<br/>
<i>Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail</i>!
</p>
<p class="noindent">(<i>How Calchas read the sign; his Vision of the Future</i>.)</p>
<p class="noindent">And the War-seer wise, as he looked on the Atreid Yoke<br/>
Twain-tempered, knew<br/>
Those fierce hare-renders the lords of his host; and spoke,<br/>
Reading the omen true.<br/>
“At the last, the last, this Hunt hunteth Ilion down,<br/>
Yea, and before the wall<br/>
Violent division the fulness of land and town<br/>
Shall waste withal;<br/>
If only God’s eye gloom not against our gates,<br/>
And the great War-curb of Troy, fore-smitten, fail.<br/>
For Pity lives, and those wingèd Hounds she hates,<br/>
Which tore in the Trembler’s body the unborn beast.<br/>
And Artemis abhorreth the eagles’ feast.”<br/>
<i>Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail</i>!
</p>
<p class="noindent"> (<i>He prays to Artemis to grant the fulfilment of the Sign, but, as his
vision increases, he is afraid and calls on Paian, the Healer, to hold her
back</i>.)</p>
<p class="noindent">
“Thou beautiful One, thou tender lover<br/>
Of the dewy breath of the Lion’s child;<br/>
Thou the delight, through den and cover,<br/>
Of the young life at the breast of the wild,<br/>
Yet, oh, fulfill, fulfill The sign of the Eagles’ Kill!<br/>
Be the vision accepted, albeit horrible….<br/>
<a href="#fn-5" id="fnref-5" class="pginternal">But I-ê, I-ê</a>! Stay her, O Paian, stay!<br/>
For lo, upon other evil her heart she setteth,<br/>
Long wastes of wind, held ship and unventured sea,<br/>
On, on, till another Shedding of Blood be wrought:<br/>
They kill but feast not; they pray not; the law is broken;<br/>
Strife in the flesh, and the bride she obeyeth not,<br/>
And beyond, beyond, there abideth in wrath reawoken—<br/>
It plotteth, it haunteth the house, yea, it never forgetteth—<br/>
Wrath for a child to be.”<br/>
So Calchas, reading the wayside eagles’ sign,<br/>
Spake to the Kings, blessings and words of bale;<br/>
And like his song be thine,<br/>
<i>Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail</i>!
</p>
<p class="noindent">(<i>Such religion belongs to old and barbarous gods, and brings no peace.

<p class="noindent">
Zeus! <a href="#fn-6" id="fnref-6" class="pginternal">Zeus, whate’er He be</a>,<br/>
If this name He love to hear<br/>
This He shall be called of me.<br/>

<p class="noindent">One there was who reigned of old,<br/>
Big with wrath to brave and blast,<br/>
Lo, his name is no more told!<br/>
And who followed met at last<br/>
His Third-thrower, and is gone.<br/>
Only they whose hearts have known<br/>
Zeus, the Conqueror and the Friend,<br/>
They shall win their vision’s end;
</p>
<p class="noindent">Zeus the Guide, who made man turn<br/>
Thought-ward, Zeus, who did ordain<br/>
Man by Suffering shall Learn.<br/>
So the heart of him, again<br/>
Aching with remembered pain,<br/>
Bleeds and sleepeth not, until<br/>
Wisdom comes against his will.<br/>
’Tis the gift of One by strife<br/>
Lifted to the throne of life.

<p class="noindent">
(AGAMEMNON <i>accepted the sign. Then came long delay, and storm while the
fleet lay at Aulis.</i>)</p>
<p class="noindent">So that day the Elder Lord,<br/>
Marshal of the Achaian ships,<br/>
Strove not with the prophet’s word,<br/>
Bowed him to his fate’s eclipse,<br/>
When with empty jars and lips<br/>
Parched and seas impassable<br/>
Fate on that Greek army fell,<br/>
Fronting Chalcis as it lay,<br/>
By Aulis in the swirling bay.
</p>
<p class="noindent">(<i>Till at last Calchas answered that Artemis was wroth and demanded the
death of</i> AGAMEMNON’S <i>daughter. The King’s doubt and grief</i>.)</p>
<p class="noindent">
And winds, <a href="#fn-7" id="fnref-7" class="pginternal">winds blew from Strymon River</a>,<br/>
Unharboured, starving, winds of waste endeavour,<br/>
Man-blinding, pitiless to cord and bulwark,<br/>
And the waste of days was made long, more long,<br/>
Till the flower of Argos was aghast and withered;<br/>
Then through the storm rose the War-seer’s song,<br/>
And told of medicine that should tame the tempest,<br/>
But bow the Princes to a direr wrong.<br/>
Then <a href="#fn-8" id="fnref-8" class="pginternal">“Artemis”</a> he whispered, he named the name;<br/>
And the brother Kings they shook in the hearts of them,<br/>
And smote on the earth their staves, and the tears came.
</p>
<p class="noindent">But the King, the elder, hath found voice and spoken:<br/>
“A heavy doom, sure, if God’s will were broken;<br/>
But to slay mine own child, who my house delighteth,<br/>
Is that not heavy? That her blood should flow<br/>
On her father’s hand, hard beside an altar?<br/>
My path is sorrow wheresoe’er I go.<br/>
Shall Agamemnon fail his ships and people,<br/>
And the hosts of Hellas melt as melts the snow?<br/>
They cry, they thirst, for a death that shall break the spell,<br/>
For a Virgin’s blood: <a href="#fn-9" id="fnref-9" class="pginternal">’tis a rite of old</a>, men tell.<br/>
And they burn with longing.—O God may the end be well!”
</p>
<p class="noindent">(<i>But ambition drove him, till he consented to the sin of slaying his
daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice.</i>)</p>
<p class="noindent">To the yoke of Must-Be he bowed him slowly,<br/>
And a strange wind within his bosom tossed,<br/>
A wind of dark thought, unclean, unholy;<br/>
And he rose up, daring to the uttermost.<br/>
For men are boldened by a Blindness, straying<br/>
Toward base desire, which brings grief hereafter,<br/>
Yea, and itself is grief;<br/>
So this man hardened to his own child’s slaying,<br/>
As help to avenge him for a woman’s laughter<br/>
And bring his ships relief!
</p>
<p class="noindent">Her “Father, Father,” her sad cry that lingered,<br/>
Her virgin heart’s breath they held all as naught,<br/>
Those bronze-clad witnesses and battle-hungered;<br/>
And there they prayed, and when the prayer was wrought<br/>
He charged the young men to uplift and bind her,<br/>
As ye lift a wild kid, high above the altar,<br/>
Fierce-huddling forward, fallen, clinging sore<br/>
To the robe that wrapt her; yea, he bids them hinder<br/>
The sweet mouth’s utterance, the cries that falter,<br/>
—His curse for evermore!—
</p>
<p class="noindent">With violence and a curb’s voiceless wrath.<br/>
Her stole of saffron then to the ground she threw,<br/>
And her eye with an arrow of pity found its path<br/>
To each man’s heart that slew:<br/>
A face in a picture, striving amazedly;<br/>
The little maid who danced at her father’s board,<br/>
The innocent voice man’s love came never nigh,<br/>
Who joined to his her little paean-cry<br/>
When <a href="#fn-10" id="fnref-10" class="pginternal">the third cup</a> was poured….
</p>
<p class="noindent">What came thereafter I saw not neither tell.<br/>
But the craft of Calchas failed not.—’Tis written, He<br/>
Who Suffereth Shall Learn; the law holdeth well.<br/>
And that which is to be,<br/>
Ye will know at last; why weep before the hour?<br/>
For come it shall, as out of darkness dawn.<br/>
Only may good from all this evil flower;<br/>
So prays <a href="#fn-11" id="fnref-11" class="pginternal">this Heart of Argos, this frail tower</a><br/>
Guarding the land alone.

A Fire-god, from Mount Ida scattering flame.<br/>
Whence starting, beacon after beacon burst<br/>
In flaming message hitherward. Ida first<br/>
Told Hermes’ Lemnian Rock, whose answering sign<br/>
Was caught by towering Athos, the divine,<br/>
With pines immense—yea, fishes of the night<br/>
Swam skyward, drunken with that leaping light,<br/>
Which swelled like some strange sun, till dim and far<br/>
Makistos’ watchmen marked a glimmering star;<br/>
They, nowise loath nor idly slumber-won,<br/>
Spring up to hurl the fiery message on,<br/>
And a far light beyond the Eurîpus tells<br/>
That word hath reached Messapion’s sentinels.<br/>
They beaconed back, then onward with a high<br/>
Heap of dead heather flaming to the sky.<br/>
And onward still, not failing nor aswoon,<br/>
Across the Asôpus like a beaming moon<br/>
The great word leapt, and on Kithairon’s height<br/>
Uproused a new relay of racing light.<br/>
His watchers knew the wandering flame, nor hid<br/>
Their welcome, burning higher than was bid.<br/>
Out over Lake Gorgôpis then it floats,<br/>
To Aigiplanctos, waking the wild goats,<br/>
Crying for “Fire, more Fire!” And fire was reared,<br/>
Stintless and high, a stormy streaming beard,<br/>
That waved in flame beyond the promontory<br/>
Rock-ridged, that watches the Saronian sea,<br/>
Kindling the night: then one short swoop to catch<br/>
The Spider’s Crag, our city’s tower of watch;<br/>
Whence hither to the Atreidae’s roof it came,<br/>
A light true-fathered of Idaean flame.<br/>
Torch-bearer after torch-bearer, behold<br/>

With vinegar in one phial, I warrant none<br/>
Shall lay those wranglers lovingly at one.<br/>
So conquerors and conquered shalt thou hear,<br/>
Two sundered tones, two lives of joy or fear.<br/>
Here women in the dust about their slain,<br/>
Husbands or brethren, and by dead old men<br/>
Pale children who shall never more be free,<br/>
For all they loved on earth cry desolately.<br/>
And hard beside them war-stained Greeks, whom stark<br/>
Battle and then long searching through the dark<br/>
Hath gathered, ravenous, in the dawn, to feast<br/>
At last on all the plenty Troy possessed,<br/>
No portion in that feast nor ordinance,<br/>
But each man clutching at the prize of chance.<br/>
Aye, there at last under good roofs they lie<br/>
Of men spear-quelled, no frosts beneath the sky,<br/>
No watches more, no bitter moony dew….<br/>
How blessèd they will sleep the whole night through!<br/>
Oh, if these days they keep them free from sin<br/>
Toward Ilion’s conquered shrines and Them within<br/>
Who watch unconquered, maybe not again<br/>
The smiter shall be smit, the taker ta’en.<br/>
May God but grant there fall not on that host<br/>
The greed of gold that maddeneth and the lust<br/>
To spoil inviolate things! But half the race<br/>
Is run which windeth back to home and peace.<br/>

Land of my fathers! Argos! Am I here …<br/>
Home, home at this tenth shining of the year,<br/>
And all Hope’s anchors broken save this one!<br/>
For scarcely dared I dream, here in mine own<br/>
Argos at last to fold me to my rest….<br/>
But now—All Hail, O Earth! O Sunlight blest!<br/>
And Zeus Most High!

No more on us be thy swift arrows poured!<br/>
Beside Scamander well we learned how true<br/>
Thy hate is. Oh, as thou art Healer too,<br/>
Heal us! As thou art Saviour of the Lost,<br/>
Save also us, Apollo, being so tossed<br/>
With tempest! … All ye Daemons of the Pale!<br/>
And Hermes! Hermes, mine own guardian, hail!<br/>
Herald beloved, to whom all heralds bow….<br/>
Ye Blessèd Dead that sent us, receive now<br/>
In love your children whom the spear hath spared.<br/>
O House of Kings, O roof-tree thrice-endeared,<br/>
O solemn thrones! O gods that face the sun!<br/>
Now, now, if ever in the days foregone,<br/>
After these many years, with eyes that burn,<br/>
Give hail and glory to your King’s return!<br/>
For Agamemnon cometh! A great light<br/>
Cometh to men and gods out of the night.<br/>
Grand greeting give him—aye, it need be grand—<br/>
Who, God’s avenging mattock in his hand,<br/>
Hath wrecked Troy’s towers and digged her soil beneath,<br/>
Till her gods’ houses, they are things of death;<br/>
Her altars waste, and blasted every seed<br/>
Whence life might rise! So perfect is his deed,<br/>
So dire the yoke on Ilion he hath cast,<br/>
The first Atreides, King of Kings at last,<br/>
And <a href="#fn-22" id="fnref-22" class="pginternal">happy among men</a>! To whom we give<br/>
Honour most high above all things that live.<br/>
For Paris nor his guilty land can score<br/>
The deed they wrought above the pain they bore.<br/>
“Spoiler and thief,” he heard God’s judgement pass;<br/>
Whereby he lost his plunder, and like grass<br/>
Mowed down his father’s house and all his land;<br/>

Silence in wrong is our best medicine here.</p>

Even so! ’Tis past, and all is victory.<br/>
And, for our life in those long years, there were<br/>
Doubtless some grievous days, and some were fair.<br/>
Who but a god goes woundless all his way?….<br/>
Oh, could I tell the sick toil of the day,<br/>
The evil nights, scant decks ill-blanketed;<br/>
The rage and cursing when our daily bread<br/>
Came not! And then on land ’twas worse than all.<br/>
Our quarters close beneath the enemy’s wall;<br/>
And rain—and from the ground the river dew—<br/>
Wet, always wet! Into our clothes it grew,<br/>
Plague-like, and bred foul beasts in every hair.<br/>
Would I could tell how ghastly midwinter<br/>
Stole down from Ida till the birds dropped dead!<br/>
Or the still heat, when on his noonday bed<br/>
The breathless blue sea sank without a wave!….<br/>
Why think of it? They are past and in the grave,<br/>
All those long troubles. For I think the slain<br/>
Care little if they sleep or rise again;<br/>
And we, the living, wherefore should we ache<br/>
With counting all our lost ones, till we wake<br/>
The old malignant fortunes? If Good-bye<br/>
Comes from their side, Why, let them go, say I.<br/>
Surely for us, who live, good doth prevail<br/>
Unchallenged, with no wavering of the scale;<br/>
Wherefore we vaunt unto these shining skies,<br/>
As wide o’er sea and land our glory flies:<br/>
“By men of Argolis who conquered Troy,<br/>
<a href="#fn-24" id="fnref-24" class="pginternal">These spoils</a>, a memory and an ancient joy,<br/>
Are nailed in the gods’ houses throughout Greece.”<br/>
Which whoso readeth shall with praise increase<br/>
Our land, our kings, and God’s grace manifold<br/>
Which made these marvels be.—My tale is told.
</p>
<p class="noindent">LEADER.<br/>
Indeed thou conquerest me. Men say, the light<br/>

Long since I lifted up my voice in joy,<br/>
When the first messenger from flaming Troy<br/>
Spake through the dark of sack and overthrow.<br/>
And mockers chid me: “Because beacons show<br/>
On the hills, must Troy be fallen? Quickly born<br/>
Are women’s hopes!” Aye, many did me scorn;<br/>
Yet gave I sacrifice; and by my word<br/>
Through all the city <a href="#fn-25" id="fnref-25" class="pginternal">our woman’s cry</a> was heard,<br/>
Lifted in blessing round the seats of God,<br/>
And slumbrous incense o’er the altars glowed<br/>
In fragrance.<br/>
And for thee, what need to tell<br/>
Thy further tale? My lord himself shall well<br/>
Instruct me. Yet, to give my lord and king<br/>
All reverent greeting at his homecoming—<br/>
What dearer dawn on woman’s eyes can flame<br/>
Than this, which casteth wide her gate to acclaim<br/>
The husband whom God leadeth safe from war?—<br/>
Go, bear my lord this prayer: That fast and far<br/>
He haste him to this town which loves his name;<br/>
And in his castle may he find the same<br/>
Wife that he left, a watchdog of the hall,<br/>
True to one voice and fierce to others all;<br/>
A body and soul unchanged, no seal of his<br/>
Broke in the waiting years.—No thought of ease<br/>
Nor joy from other men hath touched my soul,<br/>
Nor shall touch, until <a href="#fn-26" id="fnref-26" class="pginternal">bronze be dyed like wool</a>.<br/>

Spoke by a royal Queen doth shame her not.

Towered over us, and winds from Strymon drave<br/>

Of the mad whirlwind gored and overborne,<br/>
One here, one there, ’mid rain and blinding spray,<br/>
Like sheep by a devil herded, passed away.<br/>
And when the blessèd Sun upraised his head,<br/>
We saw the Aegean waste a-foam with dead,<br/>
Dead men, dead ships, and spars disasterful.<br/>
Howbeit for us, our one unwounded hull<br/>
Out of that wrath was stolen or begged free<br/>
By some good spirit—sure no man was he!—<br/>
Who guided clear our helm; and on till now<br/>
Hath Saviour Fortune throned her on the prow.<br/>
No surge to mar our mooring, and no floor<br/>
Of rock to tear us when we made for shore.<br/>
Till, fled from that sea-hell, with the clear sun<br/>
Above us and all trust in fortune gone,<br/>
We drove like sheep about our brain the thoughts<br/>
Of that lost army, broken and scourged with knouts<br/>
Of evil. And, methinks, if there is breath<br/>
In them, they talk of us as gone to death—<br/>
How else?—and so say we of them! For thee,<br/>
Since Menelaüs thy first care must be,<br/>
If by some word of Zeus, who wills not yet<br/>
To leave the old house for ever desolate,<br/>
Some ray of sunlight on a far-off sea<br/>
Lights him, yet green and living … we may see<br/>
His ship some day in the harbour!—’Twas the word<br/>
Of truth ye asked me for, and truth ye have heard!

All hail, who share with me the glory of this<br/>

On Priam’s City! Yea, though none should speak,<br/>

A concourse of all Argos, taking sure<br/>
Counsel, that what is well now may endure<br/>
Well, and if aught needs healing medicine, still<br/>

In a half-empty house, with no man near,<br/>

Of evil; now not so; then others worse,<br/>

Three robes of earth be piled, to hold him dead?<br/>

Cry not thy praise to me wide-mouthed, nor fling<br/>
Thy body down, as to some barbarous king.<br/>
Nor yet with broidered hangings strew my path,<br/>
To awake the unseen ire. ’Tis God that hath<br/>
Such worship; and for mortal man to press<br/>
Rude feet upon this broidered loveliness …<br/>
I vow there is danger in it. Let my road<br/>
Be honoured, surely; but as man, not god.<br/>
Rugs for the feet and yonder broidered pall …<br/>
The names ring diverse!… Aye, and not to fall<br/>
Suddenly blind is of all gifts the best<br/>
God giveth, for I reckon no man blest<br/>
Ere to the utmost goal his race be run.<br/>
So be it; and if, as this day I have done,<br/>
I shall do always, then I fear no ill.

How pile perdition round him, hunter-wise,<br/>
Too high for overleaping, save by lies?<br/>
To me this hour was dreamed of long ago;<br/>
A thing of ancient hate. ’Twas very slow<br/>
In coming, but it came. And here I stand<br/>
Even where I struck, with all the deed I planned<br/>
Done! ’Twas so wrought—what boots it to deny?—<br/>
The man could neither guard himself nor fly.<br/>
An endless web, as by some fisher strung,<br/>
A deadly plenteousness of robe, I flung<br/>
All round him, and struck twice; and with two cries<br/>
His limbs turned water and broke; and as he lies<br/>
I cast my third stroke in, <a href="#fn-49" id="fnref-49" class="pginternal">a prayer well-sped<br/>

That divine watchers o’er man’s death and birth<br/>
Look down on all the anguish of the earth,<br/>
Now that I see him lying, as I love<br/>
To see him, in this net the Furies wove,<br/>
To atone the old craft of his father’s hand.<br/>
For Atreus, this man’s father, in this land<br/>
Reigning, and by Thyestes in his throne<br/>
Challenged—he was his brother and mine own<br/>
Father From home and city cast him out;<br/>
And he, after long exile, turned about<br/>
And threw him suppliant on the hearth, and won<br/>
Promise of so much mercy, that his own<br/>
Life-blood should reek not in his father’s hall.<br/>
Then did that godless brother, Atreus, call,<br/>
To greet my sire—More eagerness, O God,<br/>
Was there than love!—a feast of brotherhood.<br/>
And, feigning joyous banquet, laid as meat<br/>
Before him his dead children. The white feet<br/>
And finger-fringèd hands apart he set,<br/>
Veiled from all seeing, and made separate<br/>
The tables. And he straightway, knowing naught,<br/>
Took of those bodies, eating that which wrought<br/>
No health for all his race. And when he knew<br/>
The unnatural deed, back from the board he threw,<br/>
Spewing that murderous gorge, and spurning brake<br/>
The table, to make strong the curse he spake:<br/>
“Thus perish all of <a href="#fn-54" id="fnref-54" class="pginternal">Pleisthenês</a> begot!”<br/>
For that lies this man here; and all the plot<br/>
Is mine, most righteously. For me, the third,<br/>
When butchering my two brethren, Atreus spared<br/>
And cast me with my broken sire that day,<br/>
A little thing in swaddling clothes, away<br/>
To exile; where I grew, and at the last<br/>
Justice hath brought me home! Yea though outcast<br/>
In a far land, mine arm hath reached this king;<br/>

Dead in the snare, and care not if I die!

<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-1"/> <a href="#fnref-1" class="pginternal">[P. 1, l. 1.]</a>—The
Watchman, like most characters in Greek tragedy, comes from the Homeric
tradition, though in Homer (Od. iv. 524) he is merely a servant of Aigisthos.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-2"/> <a href="#fnref-2" class="pginternal">[P. 2, l. 28, Women’s
triumph cry.]</a>—This cry of the women recurs several times in the play:
cf. p. 26, ll. 587 ff., p. 55, l. 1234. It is conventionally represented by
“ololû”; as the cry to Apollo, Paian is “I-ê,” l. 146,
and Cassandra’s sob is “ototoi” or “otototoi,” p.
47.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-3"/> <a href="#fnref-3" class="pginternal">[Pp. 3 f., ll. 40
ff.]</a>—With this silent scene of Clytemnestra’s, compare the long
silence of Cassandra below, and the silence of Prometheus in that play until
his torturers have left him. See the criticism of Aeschylus in Aristophanes,
<i>Frogs</i>, ll. 911-920, pp. 68, 69 in my translation.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-4"/> <a href="#fnref-4" class="pginternal">[P. 5, l. 104, Sign of the
War-Way.]</a>—i.e. an ominous sign seen by the army as it started on its
journey. In Homer, Iliad, ll. 305-329, it is a snake which eats the nine young
of a mother bird and then the mother, and is turned into stone
afterwards.—All through this chorus the language of the prophet Calchas
is intentionally obscure and riddling—the style of prophesy.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-5"/> <a href="#fnref-5" class="pginternal">[P. 7, l. 146, But I-ê,
i-ê.]</a>—(Pronounce <i>Ee-ay</i>.) Calchas, catching sight in his vision
of the further consequences which Artemis will exact if she fulfils the sign,
calls on Apollo Paian, the Healer, to check her.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-6"/> <a href="#fnref-6" class="pginternal">[P. 7, l. 160, Zeus,
whate’er He be.]</a>—This conception of Zeus is expressed also in
Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliant Women</i>, and was probably developed in the
Prometheus Trilogy. See my <i>Rise of the Greek Epic</i>, p. 291 (Ed. 2).<br/>
    It is connected with the common Greek conception of the <i>Tritos
Sôtêr</i>— the Saviour Third. First, He who sins; next, He who avenges;
third, He who saves. In vegetation worship it is the Old Year who has committed
Hubris, the sin of pride, in summer; the Winter who slays him; the New Year
which shall save. In mythology the three successive Rulers of Heaven are given
by Hesiod as Ouranos, Kronos, Zeus (cf. <i>Prometheus</i>, 965 ff.), but we
cannot tell if Aeschylus accepted the Hesiodic story. Cf. note on l. 246, and
Clytemnestra’s blasphemy at l. 1387, p. 63.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-7"/> <a href="#fnref-7" class="pginternal">[P. 9, l. 192, Winds from
Strymon.]</a>—From the great river gorge of Thrace, NNE; cf. below, l.
1418.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-8"/> <a href="#fnref-8" class="pginternal">[P. 9, l. 201,
Artemis.]</a>—Her name was terrible, because of its suggestion. She
demanded the sacrifice of Agamemnon’s daughter, Iphigenîa. (See
Euripides’ two plays, <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i> and <i>Iphigenia in
Aulis</i>.) In other poets Agamemnon has generally committed some definite sin
against Artemis, but in Aeschylus the death of Iphigenîa seems to be merely one
of the results of his acceptance of the Sign.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-9"/> <a href="#fnref-9" class="pginternal">[P. 10, l. 215, ’Tis a
Rite of old.]</a>—Literally “it is Themis.” Human sacrifice
had had a place in the primitive religion of Greece; hence Agamemnon could not
reject the demand of the soldiers as an obvious crime. See <i>Rise of Greek
Epic</i>, pp. 150-157.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-10"/> <a href="#fnref-10" class="pginternal">[P. 11, l. 246, The Third
Cup.]</a>—Regularly poured to Zeus Sôtêr, the Saviour, and accompanied by
a paean or cry of joy.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-11"/> <a href="#fnref-11" class="pginternal">[P. 11, l. 256, This Heart
of Argos, this frail Tower:]</a>—i.e. themselves.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-12"/> <a href="#fnref-12" class="pginternal">[P. 11, l. 264,
Glad-voiced.]</a>—Clytemnestra is in extreme suspense, as the return of
Agamemnon will mean either her destruction or her deliverance. At such a moment
there must be no ill-omened word, so she challenges fate.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-13"/> <a href="#fnref-13" class="pginternal">[P. 12, l. 276, A word
within that hovereth without wings.]</a>—i.e. a presentiment. “Winged words”
are words spoken, which fly from speaker to hearer. A ‘wingless’ word is
unspoken. The phrase occurs in Homer.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-14"/> <a href="#fnref-14" class="pginternal">[Pp. 13 ff., ll. 281
ff.]</a>—Beacon Speech. There is no need to inquire curiously into the
practical possibility of this chain of beacons. Greek tragedies do not care to
be exact about this kind of detail. There may well have been a tradition that
Agamemnon, like the Great King of Persia, used a chain of beacons across the
Aegean.—Note how vividly Clytemnestra’s imagination is working in
her excitement. She seems to see before her every leaping light in the chain,
just as in the next speech she imagines the scene in Troy almost with the
intensity of a vision.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-15"/> <a href="#fnref-15" class="pginternal">[P. 14, l. 314, Victory in
the first as in the last.]</a>—All are Victory beacons; the spirit of
Victory infects them all equally. Cf. l. 854 below, where Agamemnon prays that
the Victory which is now with him, or in him, may abide.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-16"/> <a href="#fnref-16" class="pginternal">[P. 15, l. 348, A
woman’s word.]</a>—Her hatred and fear of Agamemnon, making her
feel vividly the horrors of the sack and the peril overhanging the conquerors,
have carried her dangerously far. She checks herself and apologizes for her
womanlike anxiety. Cf. l. 1661, p. 77.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-17"/> <a href="#fnref-17" class="pginternal">[P. 18, ll. 409 ff., Seers
they saw visions.]</a>—A difficult and uncertain passage. I think the
seers attached to the royal household (cf. <i>Libation-Bearers,</i> l. 37,
where they are summoned to read a dream) were rather like what we call
clairvoyants. Being consulted, they look into some pool of liquid or the like;
there they see gradually emerging the palace, the injured King, the deserted
room, and at last a wraith of Helen herself, haunting the place.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-18"/> <a href="#fnref-18" class="pginternal">[P. 21, l.
487.]</a>—This break in the action, covering a space of several days, was
first pointed out by Dr. Walter Headlam. Incidentally it removes the gravest of
the difficulties raised by Dr. Verrall in his famous essay upon the plot of the
<i>Agamemnon</i>.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-19"/> <a href="#fnref-19" class="pginternal">[P. 21, l. 495, Dry dust,
own brother to the mire of war.]</a>—i.e. “I can see by the state
of his clothes, caked with dry dust which was once the mire of battle, that he
comes straight from the war and can speak with knowledge.” The Herald is
probably (though perhaps not quite consistently) conceived as having rushed
post-haste with his news.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-20"/> <a href="#fnref-20" class="pginternal">[Pp. 22 ff.,
HERALD.]</a>—The Herald bursts in overcome with excitement and delight,
full of love for his home and everything he sees. A marked contrast to
Agamemnon, ll. 810 ff. Note that his first speech confirms all the worst fears
suggested by Clytemnestra. Agamemnon has committed all the sins she prayed
against, and more. The terrible lines 527 ff., “Till her Gods’
Houses, etc.,” are very like a passage in the <i>Persae</i>, 811 ff.,
where exactly the same acts by the Persian invaders of Greece make their future
punishment inevitable.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-21"/> <a href="#fnref-21" class="pginternal">[P. 22, l. 509, Pythian
Lord.]</a>—Apollo is often a sinister figure in tragedy. Cf. Sophocles
<i>Oedipus</i> , ll. 915 ff., pp. 52 ff., and the similar scene,
<i>Electra</i>, 655 ff. Here it is a shock to the Herald to come suddenly on
the god who was the chief enemy of the Greeks at Troy. One feels Apollo an evil
presence also in the Cassandra scene, 11. 1071 ff., pp. 47 ff.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-22"/> <a href="#fnref-22" class="pginternal">[P. 23, l. 530, Happy among
men.]</a>—The crown of his triumph! Early Greek thought was always asking
the question, What is human happiness? To the Herald Agamemnon has achieved
happiness if any one ever did. Cf. the well-known story of Croesus asking Solon
who was the happiest man in the world (Herodotus, I. 30-33).
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-23"/> <a href="#fnref-23" class="pginternal">[P. 24, ll. 551 ff.,
Herald’s second speech.]</a>—The connexion of thought is:
“After all, why should either of us wish to die? All has ended
well.” This vivid description of the actualities of war can be better
appreciated now than it could in 1913.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-24"/> <a href="#fnref-24" class="pginternal">[P. 25, l. 577, These
spoils.]</a>—Spoils purporting to come from the Trojan War were extant in
Greek temples in Aeschylus’ day and later.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-25"/> <a href="#fnref-25" class="pginternal">[P. 26, l. 595, Our
women’s joy-cry.]</a>—There seems to have been in Argos an old
popular festival, celebrating with joy or mockery the supposed death of a man
and a woman. Homer (Od. iii. 309 f.) derives it from a rejoicing by Orestes
over Aigisthos and Clytemnestra; cf. below, ll. 1316 ff., p. 59; Aeschylus here
and Sophocles in the <i>Electra</i>, from a celebration by Clytemnestra of the
deaths of Agamemnon and Cassandra. Probably it was really some ordinary New
Year and Old Year celebration to which the poets give a tragic touch. It seems
to have had a woman’s “Ololugmos” in it, perhaps uttered by
men. See Kaibel’s note, Soph. <i>Electra</i> 277-281.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-26"/> <a href="#fnref-26" class="pginternal">[P. 26, l. 612, Bronze be
dyed like wool.]</a>—Impossible in the literal sense, but there is after
all a way of dying a sword red!
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-27"/> <a href="#fnref-27" class="pginternal">[P. 27, l. 617,
Menelaus.]</a>—This digression about Menelaus is due, as similar
digressions generally are when they occur in Greek plays, to the poet feeling
bound to follow the tradition. Homer begins his longest account of the slaying
of Agamemnon by asking “Where was Menelaus?” (Od. iii. 249).
Agamemnon could be safely attacked because he was alone. Menelaus was away,
wrecked or wind-bound.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-28"/> <a href="#fnref-28" class="pginternal">[P. 28, l. 642, Two-fold
scourge.]</a>—Ares works his will when spear crosses spear, when man
meets man. Hence “two-fold.”
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-29"/> <a href="#fnref-29" class="pginternal">[P. 29, CHORUS. The name
HELENA.]</a>—There was a controversy in Aeschylus’ day whether
language, including names, was a matter of Convention or of Nature. Was it mere
accident, and could you change the name of anything at will? Or was language a
thing rooted in nature and fixed by God from of old? Aeschylus adopts the
latter view: Why was this being called Helena? If one had understood
God’s purpose one would have seen it was because she really <i>was</i>
“Helenâs”—<i>Ship-destroyer</i>. (The Herald’s story of
the shipwreck has suggested this particular idea.) Similarly, if a hero was
called Aias, and came to great sorrow, one could see that he was so called from
‘Aiai,’ “Alas!”—The antistrophe seems to find a
meaning in the name Paris or Alexandras, where the etymology is not so clear.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-30"/> <a href="#fnref-30" class="pginternal">[Pp. 33
ff.]</a>—Entrance of Agamemnon. The metre of the Chorus indicates
marching; so that apparently the procession takes some time to move across the
orchestra and get into position. Cassandra would be dressed, as a prophetess,
in a robe of white reaching to the feet, covered by an <i>agrênon</i>, or net
of wool with large meshes; she would have a staff and certain fillets or
crowns. The Leader welcomes the King: he explains that, though he was against
the war ten years ago, and has not changed his opinion, he is a faithful
servant of the King … and that not all are equally so. He gave a similar hint
to the Herald above, ll. 546-550, p. 24.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-31"/> <a href="#fnref-31" class="pginternal">[P. 35,
Agamemnon.]</a>—A hard, cold speech, full of pride in the earlier part,
and turning to ominous threats at the end. Those who have dared to be false
shall be broken.—At the end comes a note of fear, like the fear in
Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. He is so full of triumph and success; he
must be very careful not to provoke a fall.—Victory, Nike, was to the
Greeks a very vivid and infectious thing. It clung to you or it deserted you.
And one who was really charged with Victory, like Agamemnon, was very valuable
to his friends and people. Hence they made statues of Victory wingless—so
that she should not fly away. See <i>Four Stages of Greek Religion</i>, p. 138
note.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-32"/> <a href="#fnref-32" class="pginternal">[P. 36,
Clytemnestra.]</a>—A wonderful speech. It seems to me that
Aeschylus’ imagination realized all the confused passions in
Clytemnestra’s mind, but that his art was not yet sufficiently developed
to make them all clear and explicit. She is in suspense; does Agamemnon know
her guilt or not? At least, if she is to die, she wants to say something to
justify or excuse herself in the eyes of the world. A touch of hysteria creeps
in; why could he not have been killed in all these years? Why must he rise,
like some monster from the grave, unkillable? Gradually she recovers her calm,
explains clearly the suspicious point of Orestes’ absence, and heaps up
her words and gestures of welcome to an almost oriental fullness (which
Agamemnon rebukes, ll. 918 ff., p. 39). Again, at the end, when she finds that
for the time she is safe, her real feelings almost break out.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-33"/> <a href="#fnref-33" class="pginternal">[P. 38.]</a>—What is
the motive of the Crimson Tapestries? I think the tangling robe must have been
in the tradition, as the murder in the bath certainly was. One motive, of
course, is obvious: Clytemnestra is tempting Agamemnon to sin or “go too
far.” He tries to resist, but the splendour of an oriental homecoming
seduces him and he yields. But is that enough to account for such a curious
trait in the story, and one so strongly emphasized? We are told afterwards that
Clytemnestra threw over her victim an “endless web,” long and rich
(p. 63), to prevent his seeing or using his arms. And I cannot help suspecting
that this endless web was the same as the crimson pall.<br/>
    If one tries to conjecture the origin of this curious story, it is perhaps
a clue to realize that the word <i>droitê</i> means both a bath and a
sarcophagus, or rather that the thing called droitê, a narrow stone or marble
vessel about seven feet long, was in pre-classical and post-classical times
used as a sarcophagus, but in classical times chiefly or solely as a bath. If
among the prehistoric graves at Mycenae some later peasants discovered a royal
mummy or skeleton in a sarcophagus, wrapped in a robe of royal crimson, and
showing signs of violent death—such as Schliemann believed that he
discovered—would they not say: “We found the body of a King
murdered in a bath, and wrapped round and round in a great robe?”
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-34"/> <a href="#fnref-34" class="pginternal">[P. 39
f.]</a>—Agamemnon is going through the process of temptation. He protests
rather too often and yields.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-35"/> <a href="#fnref-35" class="pginternal">[P. 39, l. 931, Tell me but
this.]</a>—This little dialogue is very characteristic of Aeschylus.
Euripides would have done it at three times the length and made all the points
clear. In Aeschylus the subtlety is there, but it is not easy to follow.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-36"/> <a href="#fnref-36" class="pginternal">[P. 40, l. 945, These bound
slaves.]</a>—i.e. his shoes. The metaphor shows the trend of his
unconscious mind.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-37"/> <a href="#fnref-37" class="pginternal">[P. 41, l. 950, This
princess.]</a>—This is the first time that the attention of the audience
is drawn to Cassandra. She too is one of Aeschylus’ silent figures. I
imagine her pale, staring in front of her, almost as if in a trance, until
terror seizes her at Clytemnestra’s greeting in l. 1035, p. 45.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-38"/> <a href="#fnref-38" class="pginternal">[P. 41, l. 964, The
cry.]</a>—i.e. the cry of the possessed prophetess which rang from the
inner sanctuary at Delphi and was interpreted by the priests.—The last
two lines of the speech are plain in their meaning but hard to translate.
Literally: “when the full, or fulfilled, man walketh his home,—O
Zeus the Fulfiller, fulfil my prayers.”
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-39"/> <a href="#fnref-39" class="pginternal">[P. 42, l.
976.]</a>—The victim has been drawn into the house; the Chorus sing a low
boding song: every audience at a Greek tragedy would expect next to hear a
death cry from within, or to see a horrified messenger rush out. Instead of
which the door opens and there is Clytemnestra: what does she want? “Come
thou also!” One victim is not enough.—In the next scene we must
understand the cause of Clytemnestra’s impatience. If she stays too long
outside, some one will warn Agamemnon; if she leaves Cassandra, she with her
second sight will warn the Chorus. If Cassandra could only be got inside all
would be safe!
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-40"/> <a href="#fnref-40" class="pginternal">[P. 44, l. 1022, “One
there was of old.”]</a>—Asklêpios, the physician, restored
Hippolytus to life, and Zeus blasted him for so oversetting the laws of nature.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-41"/> <a href="#fnref-41" class="pginternal">[P. 45, l. 1040,
Alcmêna’s son.]</a>—Heracles was made a slave to Omphalê, Queen of
Lydia. His grumbles at his insufficient food were a theme of comedy.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-42"/> <a href="#fnref-42" class="pginternal">[P. 45, l. 1049, Belike
thou canst not yet.]</a>—Cf. below, ll. 1066 ff. The Elder speaks in
sympathy. “Very likely you cannot yet bring yourself to submit.”
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-43"/> <a href="#fnref-43" class="pginternal">[P. 46, l. 1061, Thou show
her.]</a>—It seems odd to think that this passage has for centuries been
translated as if it was all addressed to Cassandra: “But if you do not
understand what I say, please indicate the same with your barbarous
hand!”—What makes Cassandra at last speak? I think that the Elder
probably touches her, and the touch as it were breaks the spell.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-44"/> <a href="#fnref-44" class="pginternal">[P. 47, l. 1072,
Cassandra.]</a>—“Otototoi” really takes the place of a stage
direction: she utters a long low sob.—The exclamation which I have
translated “Dreams!” seems to occur when people see ghosts or
visions. <i>Alcestis</i>, 261; <i>Prometheus</i>, 567. Cf. <i>Phoenissae</i>
1296.—“Mine enemy!” The name “Apollon” suggested
“<i>apollyon,”</i> Destroying … the form which is actually used in
the Book of Revelation (Rev. ix. 11).<br/>
    Observe how, during the lyric scene, Cassandra’s vision grows
steadily more definite: First vague horror of the House: then the sobbing of
children, slain long ago: then, a new deed of blood coming; a woman in it: a
wife: then, with a great effort, an attempt to describe the actual slaying in
the bath. Lastly, the sight of herself among the slain. (This last point is
greatly developed by Euripides, <i>Trojan Women</i>, ll. 445 ff., pp. 33
f.).<br/>
    The story of the Children of Thyestes is given below, ll. 1590 ff., p. 73.
Procnê (or Philomêla) was an Attic princess who, in fury against her Thracian
husband, Tereus, killed their child Itys, or Itylus, and was changed into a
nightingale, to weep for him for ever.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-45"/> <a href="#fnref-45" class="pginternal">[P. 52, ll. 1178
ff.]</a>—Dialogue. During the lyrics Cassandra has been
“possessed” or “entranced”: the turn to dialogue marks
a conscious attempt to control herself and state plainly her message of
warning. In order to prove her power, she first tells the Elders of deeds done
in the past which are known to them but cannot have been known to her. When
once they are convinced of her true seercraft, she will be able to warn them of
what is coming!—The short ‘stichom[^y]thia’[**TR: This is a y
with a circumflex, not a superscript.] (line for line dialogue), dealing in
awed whispers with things which can hardly be spoken, leaves the story of
Cassandra still a mystery. Then her self-control breaks and the power of the
God sweeps irresistibly upon her; cf. below, ll. 1256 ff.; where it comes at
her like a visible shape of fire, a thing not uncommon with modern
clairvoyants.

<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-48"/> <a href="#fnref-48" class="pginternal">[P. 60, ll. 1343 ff., The
death cry; the hesitation of the Elders.]</a>—This scene is often
condemned or even ridiculed; I think, through misunderstanding. We knew the Old
Men were helpless, like “dreams wandering in the day.” It is
essential to the story that when the crisis comes they shall be found wanting.
But they are neither foolish nor cowardly; each utterance in itself is natural
and characteristic, but counsels are divided. One would like to know whether
Aeschylus made them speak together confusedly, as would certainly be done on
the modern stage, or whether the stately conventions of Greek tragedy preferred
that each speaker should finish his say. In any case, what happens is that
after a moment or two of confused counsel the Elders determine to break into
the Palace, but as they are mounting the steps the great doors are flung open
and Clytemnestra confronts them, standing over the dead bodies of Agamemnon and
Cassandra.<br/>
    The illusion intended is that the Elders have entered the Palace and
discovered Clytemnestra. But, as the mechanical arrangements of the Greek stage
were not equal to this sudden change of scene, and since also it would, even
with perfect machinery, have a tiresome interrupting effect, a slight confusion
or inconsistency is allowed. We are supposed to be inside the house; but as a
matter of fact the supposition is soon forgotten, and the play goes on without
any attention to the particular place of the action. On Clytemnestra’s
speech see Introduction, p. xiii.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-49"/> <a href="#fnref-49" class="pginternal">[P. 63, l. 1387, A prayer
well sped to Zeus of Hell]</a>—As the third gift or libation was ritually
given to Zeus the Saviour, Clytemnestra blasphemously suggests that her third
and unnecessary blow was an acceptable gift to a sort of anti-Zeus, a Saviour
of Death.

<a id="fn-50"/> <a href="#fnref-50" class="pginternal">[P. 65, l. 1436,
Aigisthos.]</a>—At last the name is mentioned which has been in the mind
of every one!—Chrysêïs was a prisoner of war, daughter of Chrysês, priest
of Apollo. Agamemnon was made to surrender her to her father, and from this
arose his quarrel with Achilles, which is the subject of the Iliad.

<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-51"/> <a href="#fnref-51" class="pginternal">[Pp. 67-72, ll. 1468-1573,

become a Wrath, an ‘Alastor’ or ‘Driver Astray.’ See

different speakers is, of course, conjectural. Ancient dramas come down to us
with no stage directions and very imperfect indications of the speakers.

<p class="footnote">
<a id="fn-53"/> <a href="#fnref-53" class="pginternal">[P. 72, l. 1579,
AIGISTHOS.]</a>—The entry of Aigisthos enlivens the scene again after the
brooding and bewildered end of the dialogue between Clytemnestra and the
Elders. At the same time, it seems, no doubt by deliberate intention, to reduce
it to commonplace. Aigisthos’ self-defence is largely justified, but he
is no hero.

father’s grave.

1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
